For this lab, my partner was Jeffrey Zhu. We each had a Beagle Bone Green Wireless.
First we followed the instructions posted in the Piazza forum to set up the Beagle
Bone. 

As both of us did have Macintosh computers we had to visit a newer version of the 
HoRnDIS package. After I downloaded this version which I also found on Piazza,
I ran the command:
(sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext)
This fixed the problem of not having the correct drivers installed for the BeagleBone.

After setting up the Beagle Bone, my partner and I set up server and client side
ssh on both beagle bones. 
First I ran:
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

We realized openssh-server, gedit, and xterm was not installed so we ran
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install gedit
sudo apt-get install xterm

Then I ran:
$ ssh-keygen
This function generated the public and private keys for my beaglebone. 
All of the directories were left to the default by not entering anything
and pressing enter.

Then I created a useraccount for Jeffrey on my BeagleBone

$ sudo useradd –d /home/Jeffrey –m JeffreyZhu
$ sudo passwd JeffreyZhu
$ Passphrase? jeff

Afterwards I created the .ssh folder, so that Jeffrey can input his own keys.
I also used chown and chmod to give Jeffrey read and write permissions to the
folder and also change to owner of the folder.

$ cd /home/JeffreyZhu
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown –R JeffreyZhu .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

After setting this up, we each grabbed our own ip addresses using 
$ipconfig

Mine was 10.97.85.11 and Jeffrey's was 10.97.85.6.

After acquiring ip-addresses, we set up our client sides:
$ ssh-agent
$ ssh-copy-id –i kevin@10.97.85.6
$ ssh-add

I copied my ssh keys to the remote server and started an ssh-agent.
Then I added the ssh key to the authentication agent.
Since Jeffrey set up my account on his Beagle Bone, we both made sure we were connected
to the same wifi network.

I ran:

$ ssh kevin@10.97.85.6
And inputted the passphrase he set for me: kev.

After seemingly logging in, I ran a simple function to make sure his beagle was receiving my commands.
$ mkdir kevin

To exit out I ran
$ exit

To ssh using X-Forwarding, I first logged out of the beaglebone and went to my XQuartz terminal
which is located on my Mac in the Utility folder. In the top navigation bar, I select Application
-> Terminal then I run

$sudo ssh -X debian@192.168.7.2

Then I ssh'd into Jeffrey's BeagleBone using:

ssh -X kevin@10.97.85.6

Then I ran the following programs to make sure they were working correctly.
gedit
xterm
firefox

Although each program worked a bit slow, the overall functionality all worked fine.
